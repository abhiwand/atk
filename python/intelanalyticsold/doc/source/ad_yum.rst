Yum Repo (Red Hat & Similar Systems)
====================================

------------------------------------
Configure File Installation Software
------------------------------------

First add the epel RHEL/Centos::

    wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
    sudo rpm -ivh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

Now build a yum repo file '/etc/yum.repos.d/bda-internal-yum-deps.repo' with the following contents:

>>> [bda-internal-yum-deps]
... name=bda-internal-yum-deps
... baseurl=https://bda-public-repo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/yum
... gpgcheck=0
... priority=1
... enabled=1

.. ifconfig:: internal_docs

    ------------
    Inside Intel
    ------------
    If you are working inside Intel you need to create another repo file which will include the branch you would like to work out of.
    The repo url is ``https://bda-internal-yum.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/MY-Branch`` where My-Branch is the name of the branch you'd like to track.
    'bda-internal-yum' holds all the repos for branches built from Team City.
    If your branch built successfully you should have a repo available for that branch.

    Create a yum repo file '/etc/yum.repos.d/bda-internal-yum.repo' with the following contents:

    >>> [bda-internal-yum]
    ... name=bda-internal-yum
    ... baseurl=https://bda-internal-yum.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/My-Branch
    ... gpgcheck=0
    ... priority=1
    ... enabled=1

    Note:
        Change "My-Branch" to the name of the real branch!

    -------------
    Outside Intel
    -------------

Install the yum-s3 plugin::

    sudo yum install yum-s3

Create a yum repo file '/etc/yum.repos.d/bda-internal-yum.repo' with the following contents:

>>> [bda-internal-yum]
... name=bda internal yum
... baseurl=https://bda-internal-yum.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/TRIBECA_PRODUCTION_SOURCE
... gpgcheck=0
... priority=1
... s3_enabled=1
... #yum-get iam only has get
... key_id=AKIAJRVHQZHGTIVGBGJA
... secret_key=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

Note:
    The normal yum security plugin conflicts with the yum-s3 plugin so, for now, disable it.
    The yum security plugin configuration can be found in '/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/security.conf'.
    Edit the file and change the "enabled" value to 0.

Installing the Intel® Analytics Package
---------------------------------------

Do a search for "intelanalytics"::

    sudo yum search intelanalytics

This should return with two new packages "intelanalytics-python-rest-client" and "intelanalytics-rest-server"

Looking at their information::

    yum info intelanalytics*

will return something like this::

    Name        : intelanalytics-python-rest-client
    Arch        : x86_64
    Version     : 0.8.292
    Release     : 292
    Size        : 795 k
    Repo        : installed
    From repo   : bda-internal-yum
    Summary     : intelanalytics-python-rest-client-0.8
    URL         : graphtrial.intel.com
    License     : Confidential
    Description : intelanalytics-python-rest-client-0.8

    Name        : intelanalytics-rest-server
    Arch        : x86_64
    Version     : 0.8.292
    Release     : 292
    Size        : 150 M
    Repo        : installed
    From repo   : bda-internal-yum
    Summary     : intelanalytics-rest-server-0.8
    URL         : graphtrial.intel.com
    License     : Confidential
    Description : intelanalytics-rest-server-0.8

Install the Intel® Analytics package::

    sudo yum install intelanalytics*

Congratulations, you have installed the Intel® Analytics package.
