 * Command for calculating summary statistics for a dataframe column.

 * @param weightsColumn Optional. Name of the column that provides weights (frequencies).
 * @param usePopulationVariance If true, variance calculated is the population variance. If false or the option is not
 *                              provided, the variance calculated is the sample variance. Because this option affects
 *                              the variance, it affects the standard deviation and the confidence intervals as well.

/**
 * Summary statistics for a dataframe column. All values are optionally weighted by a second column. If no weights are
 * provided, all elements receive a uniform weight of 1. If any element receives a weight <= 0, that element is thrown
 * out of the calculation. If a row contains a NaN or infinite value in either the data or weights column, that row is
 * skipped and a count of bad rows is incremented.
 *
 *
 * @param mean Arithmetic mean of the data.
 * @param geometricMean Geometric mean of the data. None when there is a non-positive data element, 1 if there are no
 *                       data elements.
 * @param variance If sample variance is used,  the variance  is the weighted sum of squared distances from the mean is
 *                 divided by the sum of weights minus 1 (NaN if the sum of the weights is <= 1).
 *                 If population variance is used, the variance is the weighted sum of squared distances from the mean
 *                 divided by the sum of weights.
 * @param standardDeviation Square root of the variance. None when sample variance is used and the sum of the weights
 *                          is <= 1.
 * @param totalWeight The sum of all weights over valid input rows. (Ie. neither data nor weight is NaN, or infinity,
 *                    and weight is > 0).
 * @param minimum Minimum value in the data. None when there are no data elements of positive weight.
 * @param maximum Maximum value in the data. None when there are no data elements of positive weight.
 * @param meanConfidenceLower: Lower limit of the 95% confidence interval about the mean. Assumes a Gaussian RV.
 *                             None when there are no elements of positive weight.
 * @param meanConfidenceUpper: Upper limit of the 95% confidence interval about the mean. Assumes a Gaussian RV.
 *                             None when there are no elements of positive weight.
 * @param badRowCount The number of rows containing a NaN or infinite value in either the data or weights column.
 * @param goodRowCount The number of rows containing a NaN or infinite value in either the data or weight
 * @param positiveWeightCount  The number valid data elements with weights > 0.
 *                             This is the number of entries used for the calculation of the statistics.
 * @param nonPositiveWeightCount The number valid data elements with weight <= 0.
