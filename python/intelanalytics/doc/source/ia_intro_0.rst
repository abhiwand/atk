The revolution known as “big data” is transforming industries and research, and spawning new solutions to address a range of societal challenges.
Big data strategies usually begin by capturing the growing volume and diversity of data on Apache Hadoop-based platforms because these platforms
provide massive scalability, cost effectiveness, and a vibrant open source ecosystem.
However, once data has been captured, achieving anticipated business insights remains elusive.
Scarcity in data science expertise is exacerbated by learning new skills needed to program the myriad of open source tools, and the resulting
workflows that are inefficient for iteration and collaboration.
In addition, existing tools are often geared towards answering known questions, and their methods to discover signals from the connections
prevalent in big data are limited.

The Intel Analytics Toolkit addresses these barriers by enabling data scientists to achieve deeper insights faster, and with reduced complexity.
A simpler programming environment lets data scientists focus on analytics using cost effective, powerful open source engines without needing to
master the low level programming and technology intricacies.  This enables orchestrating the end-to-end analytics workflow in a single programming
environment that improves collaboration, iteration, and better time to deployment.
The toolkit unifies entity-based machine learning with end-to-end graph processing, and includes powerful, scalable algorithms for uncovering
relationships that are hidden in big data.
In addition, the modular framework enables users or developers to extend and integrate new functionality and algorithms.
