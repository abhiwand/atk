This guide will walk you through the process of configuring Cloudera Hadoop 5
on a physical or virtual cluster.

------------------------
Install Cloudera Manager
------------------------
Download and install the `Cloudera Manager`_.

---------------------------------------------
Set Proxy and Parcel Info in Cloudera Manager
---------------------------------------------

The first step to take in the Cloudera Manager web interface is to add your
proxy information.

1.  Click the *Cloudera Manager* hyperlink graphic on the top left portion of
    the window
#.  Click the *Administration* drop-down along the top of the window, then
    select *Settings*
#.  Select the *Network* button along the menu pane to the left
#.  In the *Proxy Server* field, enter the proxy qualified name, for example,
    ``proxy.my.company.com``
#.  In the *Proxy Port* field, enter your proxy port number
#.  Select the *Parcels* button along the menu pane to the left

    a.  Overwrite the field that says
        ``http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh5/parcels/latest/`` with
        ``http//archive.cloudera.com/cdh5/parcels/5.1.2/``

#.  Hit the *Save Changes* button to the top right of the active menu
#.  Hit the admin drop-down menu at the top right corner of the window and
    logout
#.  Log back in using the same admin username password combo

-------------------
Submit License File
-------------------

To complete this step, you must first acquire the Cloudera license file.

1.  Under the *Cloudera Enterprise* column, click on the empty text field to
    the left of the Upload button
#.  Select the license file
#.  Hit the *Upload* button
#.  Hit *Continue* on the bottom right of the window  

----------------
Specifying Hosts
----------------

This step connects your master node to the rest of the cluster.
The syntax used to search for hostnames is identical to what you will find in
the ``/etc/hosts`` file or by |DNS| lookup.

Hit *Continue* through the "Thank you for choosing Cloudera Manager and |CDH|"
window.
In the text field, enter the hostnames of each node in the following syntax::

    master.clustername.cluster
    node[01-03].clustername.cluster

Where ``clustername`` is the name of your cluster, and ``[01-03]`` is the range
of slave nodes in your cluster (``[01-07]`` for an 8 node cluster,
``[01-15]`` for a 16 node cluster).

Hit *Search* and make sure that you detect as many hosts as there are nodes in
your cluster.
See :ref:`ad_inst_cloudera_04` for examples.
If all correct hosts are selected, hit *Continue*.
Otherwise, click *New Search*.

------------------------------
Select |CDH| Parcel Repository
------------------------------

The repository/proxy information should populate the parcel list in a minute.
If not, click on *More Options* field to reconfigure.
Make sure ``CDH-5.1.2-1.cdh5.1.2.p).3`` is selected under *Remote Parcel
Repository* and then hit *Continue*.

-----------------------
Java Encryption Setting
-----------------------
Java encryption is not currently supported.

---------------------
SSH Login Credentials
---------------------
Fill out appropriate login information for |CDH| administrator user.

--------------------------------------
Wait Through Installation on All Nodes
--------------------------------------
The next couple of windows are just progress bars.
If any of them fail and turn red, sometimes just hitting *Retry* will fix the
problem nodes.

Hit *Continue* button when it lights up after the progress bar fills.
You will be greeted by more progress bars.
Wait and hit *Continue* when they finish too.

--------------------------------------
Inspect Hosts For Proper Configuration
--------------------------------------
Check that the host inspector doesn't throw any critical errors at you.
Take note of anything else that doesn't have a green check mark next to it and
resolve issue.

Click *Finish*

------------------------------------------------------
Choose the |CDH| 5 Services to Install On Your Cluster
------------------------------------------------------

The following windows will bring you through the process of installing services
and roles on each node in the cluster.
This is our default setup.

In the "Choose a combination of services to install" dialogue, select the
"Custom Services" button.
In the drop-down menu, mark the following boxes:

* HBase
* HDFS
* Spark
* YARN (MR2 Included)
* ZooKeeper

Click *Continue*.

--------------------------
Customize Role Assignments
--------------------------

This page allows you to designate which roles your different nodes will take up.
In a default loadout, almost all of these fields will be left to their default, but there are four that need to be changed.

1. Under the HBase section, click on the *HBase Thrift Server* dialogue and select the "master" node of your cluster
#. Under the |HDFS| section, click on the *Secondary Name Node* dialogue and select "node01" of your cluster
#. Under the *YARN* section, click on the *Job History Server* dialogue and select "node01" of your cluster
#. Under the *ZooKeeper* section, click on the *Server* dialogue and select "node01", "node02" and "node03" of your cluster

Leave all other fields in their default values and click *Continue*.

Click *Continue*.

--------------------------------
Finishing Up in Cloudera Manager
--------------------------------

The next page requires no interaction. Just more loading bars.

1.  Wait for all services to start up, then hit *Continue*
#.  In the *Congratulations!* window, click *Finish*
#.  Some of the health indicators may be orange or red in the first few moments of the cluster's life.
    Wait a minute for them to all turn green.
#.  In the Cloudera Manager page, change the name of the cluster by hitting the drop down arrow to
    the right of the *Cluster 1* heading then clicking *Rename Cluster*
#.  In the Cloudera Manager, hit the admin drop-down at the top right corner of the screen and select *Change Password*.
    Change the password as desired
#.  Select the Spark service from the homescreen
    a.  Select *Configuration* along the top Spark menu
    #.  Select *Worker Default Group* along the left side menu pane
    #.  Select the *Work Directory* field and change the value to a directory with the capacity to store lots of temporaty data (the /mnt directory for virtual clusers)

Final Settings and Tests
------------------------ 
Test functionality of |HDFS|.

Tweaks

The graph machine learning algorithms in our toolkit use the Giraph graph-processing framework.
Giraph is designed to run the whole graph computation in memory, and requires large amounts of memory to process big graphs.
We recommend at least 4GB of memory per map task to cater for graphs with supernodes.
Giraph jobs are scheduled using YARN.
If a Giraph job requests twice the amount of memory configured in YARN, then the YARN resource manager will not schedule it causing the job to hang.

To run Giraph jobs, ensure that the memory settings in |CDH| match those in application.conf using one of the following approaches: 

1.  Modify the following YARN configuration in |CDH| to match the setting under intel.analytics.giraph in application.conf.
    Under the YARN section in |CDH|, click on *Configuration* and select *View and Edit*.

    a.  Search for ``mapreduce.map.memory.mb`` in the search box on the upper left corner.
        Modify ``mapreduce.map.memory.mb`` to match mapreduce.map.memory.mb in application.conf (currently 8192 MB)
    #.  Search for ``mapreduce.map.java.opts.max`` in the search box.
        Modify this setting to match mapreduce.map.java.opts in application.conf (currently 6554MB).
        The rule of thumb is that mapreduce.map.java.opts.max should be at most 85% of mapreduce.map.memory.mb
    #.  Search for ``yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb`` in the search box. 
        Modify this setting to a multiple of ``mapreduce.map.memory.mb``.
        For example, if you would like to run at most 4 mappers on each node, and ``mapreduce.map.memory.mb`` is set to 8192MB, then set ``yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb`` to 32768MB.
    #.  Save these changes.
    #.  Click on *Actions*, on the top-right corner and then *Deploy Client Configuration* to update the configurations across the cluster.
    #.  Restart YARN.

#.  Limit the Giraph memory allocation in application.conf to match the configured |CDH| settings in YARN.
    The relevant settings in our application.conf file are in intel.analytics.giraph:

    a.  mapreduce.map.memory.mb. This setting should match mapreduce.map.memory.mb in YARN.
    #.  mapreduce.map.java.opts. This setting should match mapreduce.map.java.opts.max in YARN.
    #.  giraph.maxWorkers.
        The maximum value for this setting should be the maximum number of map tasks that can run on the cluster - 1.
        One mapper is reserved for the Giraph master, while the rest of the mappers are Giraph workers.
        Since Giraph is memory-intensive, a good estimate for giraph.maxWorkers is ((``Number of Yarn node managers`` * ``yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb`` / ``yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb``)-1).
