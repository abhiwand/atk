Big data has transformed industries and research, spawning new solutions for
addressing a wide range of technical challenges.
In this domain, end-to-end analytic strategies typically begin by data capture
and storage on either a distributed computing network, or HPC environment of
some kind.
However, once data has been obtained, achieving business insights has proven
difficult and expensive.
Furthermore, the fractionated nature of the data analytic software ecosystem
has caused analytical workflows to become inefficient for iteration and
collaboration, while existing tools tend to be geared toward answering known
questions, with limited software being available for exploring large, complex
data sets.

The |IAT| mitigates the difficulties associated with big data analytics,
by enabling researchers to efficiently work with their data.
An intuitive programming environment facilitates end-to-end analytic workflows
that foster collaboration, iteration, and better time-to-deployment.
Users are able to focus on analytical issues, doing their code work in a single
programming environment, without the need to master low-level programming
languages.
The toolkit unifies entity-based machine learning with end-to-end graph
processing, and includes powerful, scalable algorithms for discovering
relationships in big data, and the modular framework enables users to extend
and integrate new functionality and algorithms.
