Running Intel Analytics VM image
--------------------------------

To jump start usage of the IA toolkit we have modified the base Cloudera Virtual Box VM with the IA toolkit.
Currently the Intel Analytics toolkit VM only supports `Virtual Box <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`.
We will not cover the installation of Virtual Box.
Virtual Box supports many platforms and can be `downloaded <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads]>` for free.
The installation documentation is also `available online <https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html]>`.

Installation
============

After acquiring the VM extract the archive::

    tar -xvfÂ IntelAnalytics-0.8.0-CDH-5.0.3.tar.gz

You should have two files after extracting::

    IntelAnalytics-0.8.0-CDH-5.0.3-disk1.vmdk
    IntelAnalytics-0.8.0-CDH-5.0.3.ovf

Import
======

In Virtual Box go to the file menu then import appliance.

File \-> Import Appliance

.. image:: ad_inst_vm_01.*

Select your file.

.. image:: ad_inst_vm_02.*

Import IA VM

.. image:: ad_inst_vm_03.*

After clicking 'Import' wait for the VM to be imported

.. image:: ad_inst_vm_04.*

Once the VM is imported go ahead and boot the VM by selecting the VM and clicking start

.. image:: ad_inst_vm_05.*

Before you start
================

After every reboot of the VM you must restart the IA server.
::

    sudo service intelanalytics restart

Examples
========

The VM is pre-configured and installed with IA toolkit.
It has many examples and datasets to get you started as soon as the VM is booted.
The examples are located in '/home/cloudera/examples'.
::

    drwxr-xr-x 2 cloudera cloudera 4096 Aug  1 00:53 datasets
    -rw-r--r-- 1 cloudera cloudera 1100 Aug  1 10:15 lbp.py
    -rw-r--r-- 1 cloudera cloudera  707 Aug  1 00:53 lda.py
    -rw-r--r-- 1 cloudera cloudera  930 Aug  1 00:53 lp.py

The datasets are located in '/home/cloudera/examples/datasets' and 'hdfs://user/iauser/datasets/'.
::

    -rw-r--r--   1 iauser iauser        122 2014-08-01 00:53 /user/iauser/datasets/README
    -rw-r--r--   1 iauser iauser     617816 2014-08-01 00:53 /user/iauser/datasets/apl.csv
    -rw-r--r--   1 iauser iauser    8162836 2014-08-01 00:53 /user/iauser/datasets/lbp_edge.csv
    -rw-r--r--   1 iauser iauser     188470 2014-08-01 00:53 /user/iauser/datasets/lp_edge.csv
    -rw-r--r--   1 iauser iauser  311641390 2014-08-01 00:53 /user/iauser/datasets/test_lda.csv

The datasets in '/home/cloudera/examples/datasets' are for reference,
the actual data that is being used by the python examples and the intelanalytics server is in 'hdfs://user/iauser/datasets'.

To run any of the python example scripts, make sure you are in the examples directory and start python with the script name::

    cd /home/cloudera/examples
    python SCRIPT_NAME.py

where SCRIPT_NAME is any of the scripts in '/home/cloudera/example'.

Logs
====

If you need to debug changes to the scripts (or peak behind the curtain) the log files are located at '/var/log/intelanalytics/rest-server/output.log'.
::

    sudo tail -f /var/log/intelanalytics/rest-server/output.log

Updating
========

If you have been given access and secret keys, edit '/etc/yum.repos.d/ia.repo' and replace *myKey* and *mySecret*.
Now you will be able to run Yum commands to check for and do updates.
::

    sudo [vi/vim] /etc/yum.repos.d/ia.repo

    [Intel Analytics repo]
    name=Intel Analytics yum repo
    baseurl=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/intel-analytics-repo/release/0.8.0/yum/dists/rhel/6
    gpgcheck=0
    priority=1
    #enabled=0
    s3_enabled=0
    key_id=myKey
    secret_key=mySecret

To check for new updates and see the difference between the new and installed version::

    sudo yum info intelanalytics-rest-server

To update::

    sudo yum update intelanalytics-rest-server
