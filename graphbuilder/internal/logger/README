Logger requires parse.sh, start.sh, and stop.sh to be copied on all the slaves machine in the cluster in $HOME/log directory.

To start the logging, the user needs to invoke collect.sh <interval> on the master node. 
To stop kill the collect.sh script, run the stop-all.sh script to stop logging on all the slaves.
