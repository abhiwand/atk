Big data is transforming industries and research, and spawning new solutions for addressing a wide range of societal challenges.
Big data strategies usually begin by capturing the growing volume and diversity of data on Apache Hadoop-based platforms because these platforms
provide massive scalability, cost effectiveness, and a vibrant open source ecosystem.
However, once data has been obtained, achieving business insights remains complicated.
Scarcity in data science expertise is exacerbated by the myriad of open source tools.
The resulting workflows become inefficient for iteration and collaboration.
And existing tools are often geared towards answering known questions, with limited methods to discover signals from the connections
prevalent in big data.

The Intel Analytics Toolkit addresses these barriers by enabling data scientists to gain deeper insights faster and with reduced complexity.
A simpler programming environment enables orchestrating the end-to-end analytics workflow that improves collaboration, iteration, and better time
to deployment.
This lets data scientists develop using a single programming environment and a familiar programming language in order to focus on the analytics,
all while still using cost-effective, powerful open source engines, but without the need to master low level programming and technology.
The toolkit unifies entity-based machine learning with end-to-end graph processing, and includes powerful, scalable algorithms for uncovering
relationships that are hidden in big data, and the modular framework enables users or developers to extend and integrate new functionality
and algorithms.
