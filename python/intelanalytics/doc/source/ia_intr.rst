Introduction
============

The Intel Data Platform: Analytics Toolkit provides a unified environment for analyzing "Big Data."
It brings together the powerful new capabilities of :term:`graph analytics` with classic :term:`machine learning`.
This new toolkit enables data scientists and developers to more easily create new analytic capabilities in a platform
that is more cost effective and easier to manage than disparate, non-integrated tools.
Users can leverage the full spectrum of powerful analytic capabilities without constraining their sophistication and creativity.

Within the toolkit, Intel Graph Analytics provides an industry-first environment for creating and analyzing big data graphs
across the data science workflow.

You will import, then clean and feature engineer the data (the actual data crunching), and finally produce graphs and run analytics on those graphs.

The Analytics Toolkit is built on open source components for ease of use and integration with whatever tools you might be using now.
We use:

----------------
Support Programs
----------------

    | `Apache™ Hadoop®`_ and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
    | `Apache Giraph©`_ scalable iterative graph processing system
    | A Python-based API, using iPython_
    | `Cloudera Graph Database`_
    | `TinkerPop™ Gremlin®`_ Graph Query language

These tools work well together, and with many other open source tools.
