Graph Database
==============

The IntelÂ® Analytics Toolkit uses a :term:`graph` database to handle complex, non-tabular data.
:term:`Graph` databases represent data as a series of vertices connected by edges.
Each :term:`vertex` is a data element, like a field in a tabular database, and has a pointer (:term:`edge`) to elements adjacent to it.
You might use a :term:`graph` database to analyze the layout of an organization, or to analyze business or political relationships.
