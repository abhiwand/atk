Graph Database
==============

The IntelÂ® Data Platform: Analytics Toolkit uses a graph database to handle complex, non-tabular data.
Graph databases are described as a series of vertices connected by edges.
We use these terms throughout our documentation.
Each vertex is a data element, like a field in a relational database.
The edges connect the vertices and show the relationships between them.
You might use this to perform organizational analysis, or to analyze business, or political relationships.

The graph database does not use indices and thus, does not use index lookups.
Each data element (vertex) has a pointer (edge) to the element adjacent to it.
This is great for handling graphs, and most Big Data problems are graph data.

Gremlin

Gremlin_ is an open source, graph database, query language.
Think about it as SQL queries for graph databases.
