Easier Development
==================

The |IA| Toolkit makes analytics development easier for both experts and new practitioners due to its familiar,
consistent, and unified programming environment across the workflow :math:`-` from data preparation to queries, analytics,
and :term:`machine learning`.
Instead of switching between various low-level languages and data formatting environments of the Hadoop platform, the
analytics developer uses a convenient and easy to learn Python based environment.
Data is represented with a familiar “data frame”, and :abbr:`API (Application Programming Interface)` environment that mirrors the broadly-used and easy to learn Python
desktop analytics programming environment.
However, the |IA| Toolkit can run all analytics functionality at full cluster scale,
overcoming the memory limitations of desktop Python analytic tools.
An extensive set of libraries is provided for preparing data models, including feature engineering and data segmentation.
Deploying a unified programming approach can improve productivity by enabling easier iteration and collaboration and by
reducing the learning curve for cluster scale analytics.

Integrated Graph Processing Pipeline
====================================

Graphs represent entities as a network of verticies and connections, and analytics tools for graph data bring exciting new
capabilities for finding insights latent in data :math:`-` particularly when the connections between entities are more numerous
or more important than the entities alone.
For example, graph databases\' enable exploring linked data no matter how large the data set, in contrast with relational databases which
require table joins to traverse connections giving slowing performance as data size increases.
Graph engines enable analyzing the entire network to reveal key information about its structure, such as central influences,
embedded communities, shortest paths of connections, and mining data for clustering and :term:`classification` uses.

The |IA| Toolkit provides an environment for creating and analyzing big data graphs across the workflow,
from data extraction and wrangling, to graph construction; from query and traversal (using a graph database),
through analysis and machine learning (using the graph engine.)
With a complete graph pipeline of capabilities, exploring and productively deploying graph analytics to gain valuable
insights becomes possible and practical, without the brittle “do it yourself” approaches needed today.

Unified Graph and Entity Analytics
==================================

The |IA| Toolkit brings together graph analytics and entity-based machine learning into a single framework.
Today, analytics developers must utilize and manage the deployment of many different types of tools or forgo entire classes of advanced
capabilities that are key to understanding.
For example, extracting an entity’s nearby relationships for use as features in a machine learning model can improve predictive accuracy.
With a unified environment, data scientists can easily and cost-effectively advance toward new analytic capabilities.
Users can leverage the full spectrum of powerful analytic capabilities without constraining their sophistication and creativity. 

Scalable Distributed Algorithms
===============================

The |IA| Toolkit includes an extensive set of scalable graph-based and entity-based algorithms for creating big data solutions,
incorporating maching learning methods such as :term:`clustering`, :term:`classification`, :term:`recommendation systems`,
:term:`topic modeling`, :term:`community structure detection`.
Invocation using simple Python :abbr:`API (Application Programming Interface)` calls into the programming framework reduces the need for data scientists to be algorithm
experts in order to overcome variability in data formatting, configuration parameters, capabilities, and scalability sometimes
encountered when using open source algorithms.

Extensibility
=============

The |IA| Toolkit is based on a modular, extensible framework.
Data scientists can incorporate custom algorithms and integrate them seamless into the development workflow.
As the Hadoop technology stack expands, new capabilities can be added to the environment without requiring that data scientists master
new programming models and data formats.

Full Scalability
================

The |IA| Toolkit enables developers to utilize all available data, taking full advantage of the scalable engines provided in the
Hadoop-based data platform.
Every capability – including graph :term:`transaction processing`, classical :term:`machine learning`, graph analytic algorithms,
and graph construction, scale economically by adding more standard servers to the Hadoop cluster, equipping the developer with
advanced analytics for data of all sizes.
