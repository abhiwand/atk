Graph Sampling
==============

Analyzing a massive graph with millions or billions of nodes is a tedious and expensive process,
so most initial analysis is done on a subset of the data.
Sampling is the process whereby a subset of the data is obtained.

Traditional data sampling methods, such as simple random sampling and stratified sampling, assume that the data is
independent and identically distributed (IID.)
Although this assumption does not always hold for non-relational data, the very nature of relational data means that
any assumption of IID data can not be made.

A simple example where the IID assumption is invalid can be found with social network data.
Consider a group of individuals that each have a favorite music attribute.
There has been a tremendous amount of research in social psychology supporting the idea that members of social groups tend to influence each other.
For example, social groups might form similar music preferences.
Thus, the relationships among individuals can have a significant impact on the attributes of the individuals.

In order to deal with the potential dependencies between individual attributes, a variety of sampling techniques have been proposed
for relational (or graph) data.
These techniques are categorized as either node-based, edge-based, or exploration-based sampling.

Node-based sampling is a relational data sampling technique that is most similar to the traditional non-relational data sampling techniques.

Although uniform-weighted node sampling is often used for certain graphs (for example, single type of edge, no attributes),
there are other types of weighted node sampling.
Degree-weighted node sampling better preserves the degree distribution of a graph than uniform-weighted node sampling.
Similarly, PageRank-weighted node sampling can be used if we are concerned about preserving personal PageRank values.

Edge-based sampling is not often used due to bias that it introduces toward high-degree nodes.
Naturally, the number of edges incident on a node increases as its degree increases.
Therefore, a random selection of edges is more likely to sample edges that are incident on high-degree nodes.

Exploration-based sampling is useful in cases where we want to best preserve common structural properties of a
graph (e.g., degree distribution, clustering coefficient, density).
Random Walk, Random Jump, and Forest Fire have been used to sample graph data with good results.

Application of each algorithm and its variants (for example, Metropolis-Hasting Random Walk) should take into account the
properties of the graph being sampled.
For a simple graph without any meaningful attributes, a weighted node sampling algorithm might be sufficient.
The Forest Fire algorithm was developed to preserve the power-law properties of such graphs.
Knowledge of the graph properties will help to determine the most appropriate graph sampling algorithm.

It is worth noting that the inclusion of multiple types of edges further complicates graph sampling techniques.
Each different type of edge may induce a very different graph structure.
Therefore, it must be specified what type of edge is of interest when applying the aforementioned sampling algorithms.
