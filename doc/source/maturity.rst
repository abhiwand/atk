**API Maturity Tags**

Functions in the API may be at different levels of software maturity.  Where a function is not mature, the documentation will note it with one of the following tags.  The absence of a tag means the function is standardized and fully tested. 

.. _Alpha:

not been completely tested.  Use this function with caution.
This function may be changed or eliminated in future releases.

.. _Beta:

|BETA| Indicates a function or feature which has been developed and preliminarily
tested, but has not been completely tested.  Use this function with caution.
This function may be changed in future releases.

.. _Deprecated:

|DEPRECATED| Indicates a function or feature which is no longer supported.
It is recommended that an alternate solution be found.
This function may be removed in future releases.
