# that imports this one. This file is missing many installation-specific settings such as
# the application key, database connection information, etc.
# DO NOT add sensitive or environment-specific information to this file!

# This is the main configuration file for the application.

# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.

# by providing an application-logger.xml file in the conf directory.

# Root logger:
logger.root=ERROR

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=INFO

# Logger provided to your application:
