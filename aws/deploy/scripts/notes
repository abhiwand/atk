Cluster Creation
================
IntelAnalytics_cluster_env.sh
- global variables for creating a AWS cluster of IntelAnalytics

We suppoprt only 4 nodes per cluster now, you can use more but not tested.

Steps:
Assume you want to create a cluster of id 10, and 4 nodes, no dry-run. No
need to specify the size as by default it will be 4 nodes.

1. Set up the work dirctory, e.g.
> export IA_HOME=/home/ec2-user/intel/IntelAnalytics/0.5
If you are in the deploy/scripts already, you can just do
> export IA_HOME=`pwd`/../..

2. Create the cluster w/ a give id and size
> cd ${IA_HOME}/deploy/scripts
> ./IntelAnalytics_cluster_create.sh --cluster-id 10

We only support cluster of 4 nodes at this moment. You should see logs on
the console, as well as the log file in ${IA_HOME}/deploy/clusters/IntelAnalytics-10-4.log

3. If 2 finishes ok, go to the AWS console to verify the instances are up,
or use the ec2-describe-instance-status to check 

4. Prepare the cluster, first, generate the nodes list file and hosts file
> ./IntelAnalytics_cluster_genhosts.sh --cluster-id 10

The default outputs directory is at ${IA_HOME}/deploy/clusters, where you have
IntelAnalytics-10-4.hosts as your host file, and IntelAnalytics-10-4.nodes as
a nodes list file.

5. Prepare the data disks, using the newly generated nodes list file, you will
also need the correct private key (pem file) to allow you to ssh into the newly
launched EC2 instances, normally, this is at ${IA_HOME}/credentials, or ../../ of 
your current ./scripts direcotry:
> ./IntelAnalytics_setup_disks.sh --nodes-file ../clusters/IntelAnalytics-10-4.nodes \
--pem-file ../../credentials/IntelAnalytics_User.pem 

NOTE:
Observe the outputs to make sure the mkfs is kicked out on all four disks of all nodes,
if not, you will have to run the same command line above again and again till 
it gets started. You can verify that by doing:
> for n in `cat ../clusters/intelanalytics-10-4.nodes`; do \
ssh -i ../../credentials/telanalytics_user.pem -t ${n} 'ps aux | grep mkfs'; done

wait for the mkfs to finish, and verify they are mounted properly by:
> for n in `cat ../clusters/intelanalytics-10-4.nodes`; do \
ssh -i ../../credentials/elanalytics_user.pem -t ${n} 'mount | grep xvd'; done

The xvd{b,c,d,e} should be mounted at /mnt/disk{1,2,3,4}

6. Prepare the hadoop cluster,
> ./IntelAnalytics_cluster_configure.sh --nodes-file ../clusters/IntelAnalytics-10-4.nodes \
--hosts-file ../clusters/IntelAnalytics-10-4.hosts \
--pem-file ../../credentials/IntelAnalytics_User.pem

This should update all nodes' hosts file in the cluster, and prepare the ssh for hadoop
to do password-less login.

7. Bring up the cluster. All nodes are physically up, now you can start hadoop like regular
hadoop cluster
1) ssh to your amdin node: ssh -i ../../credentials/IntelAnalytics_User.pem ip-10-0-64-61
2) ssh from admin node to your cluster master node, look up ip/dns from the deploy/clusters subdir
3) su --l hadoop, password is ‘hadoop’. Then cd ‘IntelAnalytics”
4) Start hdfs by ~/hadoop/bin/start-dfs.sh
5) Start mapred by ~/hadoop/bin/start-mapred.sh
6) Start hbase by ~/hbase/bin/start-hbase.sh
7) Start hbase thrift by ~/hbase/bin/hbase-daemon.sh start thrift

If you have changed any configuration, you can use the tool provided to update all nodes.
Assume you are in master node su logined as 'hadoop1
> cd ~/IntelAnalytics
> bin/ia_cluster_config.sh --synconf

Or, you want to check the outsanding jvms on all nodes:
> cd ~/IntelAnalytics
> bin/ia_cluster_config.sh --jpsls


AMI Preparation
===============
IntelAnalytics_setup_env.sh
- global variables for preparing a AMI for IntelAnalytics or post configuration
- of the deployed IntelAnaltytics cluster

Steps:
1. IntelAnalytics_setup_system.sh: setup basic system config

2. IntelAnalytics_setup_user.sh: setup a given user account w/ passwordless ssh
- 1) use the account name as password
- 2) default user name is 'hadoop'

3. IntelAnalytics_setup_disks.sh: prepare the disks for data mount points of hadoop
- Assumes hard-coded device name, must match when launch intance from IS
- Takes a while for this to finish the mkfs

4. IntelAnalytics_setup_fstab_node.sh, IntelAnalytics_setup_fstab.sh: setup mount for the diesks

5. IntelAnalytics_setup_deploy.sh: deploy the package
- all configs are already updated
- should be able to just run
